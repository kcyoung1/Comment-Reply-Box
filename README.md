<h1>React Exercise 1 - Comment Reply Box</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was the first exercise we did with React. Making a comment box that stores the replies. Our instructor walked us through each step and showed us how componenets worked with each other. We learned how to use this.state and this.setState as well as the render function.</p>
